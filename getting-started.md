# Getting Started

In this tutorial, we show how to start working with Neu.ro:

* Install CLI client;
* Understand core concepts; and
* Start developing on GPU in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Installing CLI

To start working with CLI, you have two options:

* Use [Web Terminal](https://apps.neu.ro/shell?cluster_name=neuro-public)
* Install Neu.ro CLI on your machine and run `neuro login`

The first option is recommended for exporing the platform. The second option, though, is better when working on your projects.

### Linux and Mac OS instructions

Neu.ro CLI requires Python 3 installed \(recommended: 3.7, required: &gt;=3.6\). We suggest using [Anaconda Python 3.7 Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

```text
pip install -U neuromation
neuro login
```

### Windows instructions

While there are several options to make Neu.ro CLI work on Windows, we highly recommend using [Anaconda Python 3.7 Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) with default installation settings.

When you have it up and running, run the following commands in Conda Prompt:

```text
conda install -c conda-forge make
conda install -c conda-forge git    
pip install -U neuromation
pip install -U certifi
neuro login
```

## Understanding core concepts

On **Neu.ro Core** level, one works with jobs, environments, and storage. To be more specific, one runs a job \(an execution unit\) in a given environment \(Docker container\) on a given preset \(a combination of CPU, GPU, and memory resources allocated for this job\) with several parts of storage \(block or object storage\) available \(attached\).

Let us show several examples.

Run a job on CPU which prints “Hello, World!” and shuts down:

```text
neuro run --preset cpu-small --name test ubuntu echo Hello, World!
```

Upon execution of this command you’ll see an output like this:

```text
Job ID: job-2b743322-f53a-4211-be4e-5d493e6cc770 Status: pending
Name: test
Http URL: https://test--johndoe.jobs.neuro-ai-public.org.neu.ro
Shortcuts:
  neuro status test     # check job status
  neuro logs test       # monitor job stdout
  neuro top test        # display real-time job telemetry
  neuro exec test bash  # execute bash shell to the job
  neuro kill test       # kill job
Status: pending Creating
Status: pending Scheduling
StatStatus: pending ContainerCreating
Status: succeeded
Terminal is attached to the remote job, so you receive the job's output.
Use 'Ctrl-C' to detach (it will NOT terminate the job), or restart the
job with `--detach` option.                
Hello, World!
```

Run a job in Neu.ro default environment \(`neuromation/base`\) on GPU which prints checks if CUDA is available in this environment:

```text
neuro run --preset gpu-small --name test neuromation/base python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available());"
```

Check the presets you can use:

```text
neuro config show
```

Create a directory `demo` in your platform storage root:

```text
neuro mkdir -p storage:demo
```

Run a job which mounts `demo` directory on storage to `/demo` directory in the job container and creates a file in it:

```text
neuro run --preset cpu-small --name test --volume storage:demo:/demo:rw ubuntu bash -c "echo Hello >> /demo/hello.txt"
```

Check that the file is on storage:

```text
neuro ls storage:demo
```

## Developing on GPU

While one can run a Jupyter Notebooks session with one command in a command line or with one click in web UI, we recommend project-based development. To simplify the process, we provide the project template, which is a part of **Neu.ro Toolbox**, and provides the folder structure and integrations with several recommended tools.

### Initializing a project

To initialize a new project from the template, run:

```text
neuro project init
```

This command asks several questions about your project:

```text
project_name [Name of the project]: Neuro Tutorial
project_slug [neuro-tutorial]:
code_directory [modules]:
```

You can press Enter if you agree with the suggested choice.

To navigate to the project directory, run:

```text
cd neuro-tutorial
```

### Project structure

After you execute the command mentioned above, you get the following structure:

```text
neuro-tutorial
├── .neuro/             <- neuro and neuro-flow CLI configuration files
├── config/             <- configuration files for various integrations
├── data/               <- training and testing datasets (we do not keep it under source control)
├── notebooks/          <- Jupyter notebooks
├── modules/            <- source code of models
├── results/            <- training artifacts
├── .gitignore          <- default .gitignore for a Python ML project
├── HELP.md             <- autogenerated template reference
├── README.md           <- autogenerated informational file
├── Dockerfile          <- description of base image used for your project
├── apt.txt             <- list of system packages to be installed in the training environment
├── requirements.txt    <- list of Python dependencies to be installed in the training environment
└── setup.cfg           <- linter settings (Python code quality checking)
```

The template contains `neuro/live.yaml` configuration file for `neuro-flow`, which guarantees the contract between the above-shown structure, the base environment which we provide, and manipulations with storage and jobs. For example, through `upload` command, sub-folders on your local machine are uploaded with sub-folders on persistent platform storage, and those sub-folders are synced with the corresponding sub-folders in job containers.

### Setting up the environment and running Jupyter

To set up the project environment, run:

```text
neuro-flow build myimage
```

Upon execution of this command, system packages from `apt.txt` and pip dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed in the base environment, which already contains CUDA support and the most popular ML/AI frameworks, like Tensorflow and Pytorch.

To start a Jupyter Notebooks session on GPU, run:

```text
neuro-flow run jupyter
```

This command open Jupyter Notebooks interface in your default browser.

Now, when you edit notebooks, they update on your platform storage. To download them locally \(for example, to put them under version control\), run:

```text
neuro-flow download notebooks
```

Don’t forget to terminate your job when you no longer need it \(the files won’t disappear after that\):

```text
neuro-flow kill jupyter
```

To check how much GPU and CPU hours you have left, run:

```text
neuro config show-quota
```
