# Getting Started

[Neu.ro](https://neu.ro) is a flexible and robust machine learning platform. It consists of two parts:

* **Neu.ro Core** is a resource orchestrator. It can be installed in a cloud or on-premise and combines compute, storage, and environments \(Docker images\) in one system with single sign-on authentication \(SSO\) and advanced permission management system. This part frees teams from DevOps.
* **Neu.ro Toolbox** is a toolset integrator. It contains integrations with various open-source and commercial tools required for modern ML/AI development. This part addresses the majority of MLOps issues a team may have.

In this guide, we show the following operations:

* [Installing CLI](installing-cli.md): see how to install Neu.ro CLI on Linux, OS X, or Windows, or use web Terminal.
* [Meeting Neu.ro](meeting-neu.ro.md): get to know Neu.ro Core components: jobs, environments, and storage.
* [Developing on GPU](developing-on-gpu.md): start developing on GPU in Jupyter Notebooks with the help of Neu.ro Toolbox project template.
