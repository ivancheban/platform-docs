# Introduction

[Neu.ro](https://neu.ro) is a flexible and robust machine learning platform. It consists of two parts:

* **Neu.ro Core** is a resource orchestrator. It can be installed in a cloud or on-premise and combines compute, storage, and environments \(Docker images\) in one system with single sign-on authentication \(SSO\) and advanced permission management system. This part frees teams from DevOps.
* **Neu.ro Toolbox** is a toolset integrator. It contains integrations with various open-source and commercial tools required for modern ML/AI development. This part addresses the majority of MLOps issues a team may have.

If you are new to Neu.ro, here are two simple steps to get started:

* [Sign up](https://neu.ro) and get 100h of GPU compute for free.
* Follow our [Getting Started](getting-started/) guide.

If you want to dig deeper, take a look at various ML development guides we carefully craft for you, for example:

* [Experiment tracking with Weights and Biases](docs/experiment_tracking_wandb)
* [Remote debugging with PyCharm Professional](docs/remote_debugging_pycharm)

Also, take a look at our [CLI reference](/docs/cli) and [Python API reference](https://neuromation-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
