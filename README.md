# Introduction

## The basics

[Neu.ro](https://neu.ro) is a flexible and robust machine learning platform. It consists of two parts:

* **Neu.ro Core** is a resource orchestrator. It can be installed in a cloud or on-premise and combines computation capabilities, storage, and environments (Docker images) in one system with single sign-on authentication (SSO) and advanced permission management system. This frees teams working with Neu.ro from DevOps.
* **Neu.ro Toolbox** is a toolset integrator. It contains integrations with various open-source and commercial tools required for modern ML/AI development. This addresses the majority of MLOps issues a team may have.

If you're new to Neu.ro, here are two simple steps to get started:

* [Sign up](https://app.neu.ro/) and contact [support@neu.ro](https://milto:support@neu.ro) speciying your username to get 100 free credits.&#x20;

## Digging deeper

For detailed information on specific use cases, feel free to refer to our ML development guides. For example:
