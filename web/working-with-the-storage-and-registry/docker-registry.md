# Docker Registry

The Web UI allows you to view the platform's Docker image registry on the current cluster and check detailed information about the available images. This can be done with the help of the **Docker registry** browser. &#x20;

### Opening the Docker registry browser

To open the registry browser, first click **RUN A JOB** in the **Container images browser** widget on your dashboard:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

Next, click **RUN** in the **Docker registry** pop-up window:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (142).png>)

### Viewing available images

To navigate to the list of available images, click the name of the registry on the starting page of the registry browser:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (123).png>)

### Checking the versions of available images

In the list of available images, you can click the name of a specific image to view the list of its current versions:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (209).png>)

### Viewing detailed information about images

In the list of the image's current versions, clicking the name of a specific version will bring you to a window with detailed information about it:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (225).png>)

You can copy the CLI command for pulling this version of the image by clicking the **Copy** icon in the right part of the **Pull** section:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (144).png>)

### Deleting images

In the list of the image's current versions, you can delete unnecessary versions by clicking the **Delete** icon next to them:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (165).png>)
