# Projects

## What are projects?

Projects provide a way to quickly create the basic necessary folder structure and set up integrations with several recommended tools for your model development environment. 

So, once you start working with the Neu.ro platform, we highly recommend that you create a new project to ensure that the most important functionality will be accessible right away.

Every project is based on a template that contains the `.neuro/live.yaml` configuration file for [Neu.ro Flow](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neuro-flow/) - a tool that simplifies your work process with Neu.ro. This file guarantees a proper connection between the project structure, the base environment that we provide, and actions with storage and jobs.

## Creating projects

You can create new projects via Neu.ro CLI by using the following command:

```text
$ neuro project init
```

This command will prompt you to enter some info about your project - specifically, it's name, slug, and the name of the folder that will contain your custom code:

```text
project_name [Name of the project]: Neuro Tutorial
project_slug [neuro-tutorial]:
code_directory [modules]:
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Default values are indicated by square brackets **\[ \].** You can use them by pressing **Enter**.
{% endhint %}

When you create a new project, its structure will be as follows:

```text
neuro-tutorial
├── .neuro/             <- neuro and neuro-flow CLI configuration files
├── config/             <- configuration files for various integrations
├── data/               <- training and testing datasets (we do not keep it under source control)
├── notebooks/          <- Jupyter notebooks
├── modules/            <- source code of models
├── results/            <- training artifacts
├── .gitignore          <- default .gitignore for a Python ML project
├── .neuro.toml         <- autogenerated config file
├── HELP.md             <- autogenerated template reference
├── README.md           <- autogenerated informational file
├── Dockerfile          <- description of base image used for your project
├── apt.txt             <- list of system packages to be installed in the training environment
├── requirements.txt    <- list of Python dependencies to be installed in the training environment
└── setup.cfg           <- linter settings (Python code quality checking)
```

The internal ID of a project used by Neu.ro Flow is generated automatically based on the name of the root folder containing the `.neuro` folder. This can be changed by placing a `project.yml` file with the desired project ID attribute into the `.neuro` folder. Feel free to refer to the [Neu.ro Flow reference](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neuro-flow/reference/project-configuration-syntax) for more information.

## Project modes

Neu.ro Flow provides two modes of automating and simplifying your work process while working in a project - **live** mode and **batch** mode. 

### Live mode

Live mode allows to execute sets of job definitions that create independent jobs in the Neu.ro cloud. 

A job or set of jobs executed in live mode is called a **live job**.

You can learn more about live jobs in the [Neu.ro Flow reference](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neuro-flow/reference/live-workflow-syntax#live-workflow).

### Batch mode

Batch mode serves to orchestrate sets of remote tasks that depend on each other. This is achieved by having a main job that manages the overall workflow by spawning all required sub-jobs, waiting for their results, and starting dependent tasks when all of their requirements are satisfied. 

A single execution of a set of jobs in batch mode is called a **bake**.

You can learn more about the batch mode in the [Neu.ro Flow reference](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neuro-flow/reference/batch-workflow-syntax).

## Monitoring projects

You can monitor your projects both via the CLI and in the Web UI.

### Monitoring live jobs

To see a list of live jobs on the current project, their IDs, statuses, and starting times, run the following command:

```text
$ neuro-flow ps

  JOB          │ STATUS    │ RAW ID                                   │ WHEN
╶──────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────┼────────╴
  filebrowser  │ unknown   │ N/A                                      │ N/A
  jupyter      │ unknown   │ N/A                                      │ N/A
  multitrain   │ unknown   │ N/A                                      │ N/A
  remote_debug │ cancelled │ job-5938269e-4a57-408c-af39-109970ac5c59 │ Dec 22
  tensorboard  │ unknown   │ N/A                                      │ N/A
  train        │ unknown   │ N/A                                      │ N/A
               ╵           ╵                                       
```

### Monitoring bakes

Use the following command to monitor your project's bakes:

```text
$ neuro-flow bakes
```

This command will show the the ID, creation date, and the status of each bake on your project.

To see detailed info about a specific bake, use:

```text
$ neuro-flow inspect <bake-id>
```

This will show which tasks were executed in this bake, their statuses, IDs, starting and completion time. You can also export a bake's graph by adding the `--output-graph` option and choosing the desired graph format \(DOT or PDF\).  
  
You can learn more about bake inspection [here](https://neu-ro.gitbook.io/neuro-flow/reference/cli#neuro-flow-inspect).
